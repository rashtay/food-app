# Food App

A mock food app to practice React Native

### Usage

- Run `git clone https://github.com/rashtay/food-app.git` to clone the react native project.
- Rename `.env.local` to `.env`
- To install the project dependencies, run `yarn install`
- Run `npm run ios` to run on the ios device. By default, it'll run on iPhone 11. You can change the defaults in `package.json`
- To install the app on android, run `npm run android`
- To run the server, `npm start`
- To reset the cache and run the server, `npm run reset-and-start`

### Caveats

- Fonts might not be similar though I tried to use an alternative which didn't seem similar. Even system fonts weren't similar.
- I have taken the lliberty to use `react-native-vector-icons`for this project.
- Since, I believe that this test was supposed test my UI building capabilities, I have built few components like search which aren't functional to save time so that I could wrap it up soon.

# Issue Fixes

- App wasn't getting installed inn Android. The issue occurred dueto react-native-screen. It has been fixed https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens/issues/166
